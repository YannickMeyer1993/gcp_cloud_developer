## BigQuery

## Anzeigen des Meta-Daten eines Datasets:

```
-- Returns metadata for tables in a single dataset.
SELECT * FROM dataset_name.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
```

```
gcloud config set project brain-jobber-tst
bq rm -r -f -d <datasetname aus liste>
```
### Erstellen eines Datasets in der Cloud Shell (Projekt setzen auf brain-jobber-test)

## JSON Function in BigQuery

| Function            | Purpose                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
|  JSON_EXTRACT                   |    You can query the whole field of a JSON, even if it is not a scalar                             |
|  JSON_QUERY                   |    Same                               |
|   JSON_QUERY_ARRAY                  |  Enables you to query an array within a JSON                               |
|    JSON_VALUE_ARRAY                 |     Same                            |


The primary difference between the two functions is that JSON_QUERY returns an object or an array, while JSON_VALUE returns a scalar. Same with
JSON_QUERY_ARRAY/JSON_VALUE_ARRAY

### Example

```
-- Spalte ids = Array
SELECT ids.key
FROM `dataset.table_name`, UNNEST(ids) as ids
```
## STRUCT's and ARRAY's in BigQuery

Additional informations

https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/data-engineering/demos/nested.md

These types of data types are used to unite the advantages of Normalization and Denormalization. You will not have duplicate data and you still have fast
joins over all tables. Structs are pre-joined tables within a table. They have the data type RECORD and the mode is REPEATED. The function count(*) will
count the amount of entries in the "main" columns. Arrays have the data type ARRAY and the mode is also REPEATED. Arrays can be part of regular
fields or structs. A single table can have many structs. Structs can have other structs nested inside of it. BigQuery stores repeated, nested fields in a
columnar format (value + definition level + repetition level). Using Structs results in less Data Shuffling and more efficient joins.

Just as ARRAY values give you the flexibility to go deep into the granularity of your fields, another data type allows you to go wide in your schema by
grouping related fields together. That SQL data type is the STRUCT data type. STRUCTs (and ARRAYs) must be unpacked before you can operate over
their elements. Wrap an UNNEST() around the name of the struct itself or the struct field that is an array in order to unpack and flatten it.

Syntax: Inside the world of Structs, the comma is a correlated CROSS JOIN. With Array, you need to unnest the columns via the UNNEST command. The
columns have different granularity and with UNNEST we break down the repeated part in the array.

### Example: Querying Nested JSON with UNNEST


#### WITH

```
SELECT
    JSON_VALUE(dl_payload, '$.data.id') AS partner_incentive_id,
    JSON_VALUE(dl_payload, "$.data.partner.id") AS partner_id,
    JSON_VALUE(dl_payload, "$.data.kuvoName") AS partnerincentive_name,
    JSON_VALUE(dl_payload, "$.data.kuvoShortName") AS partnerincentive_short_name,
    JSON_VALUE(dl_payload, "$.data.conditionText") AS condition_text,
    JSON_QUERY(dl_payload, '$.data.accountingConditions') AS accounting_condition_array, --get whole ARRAY
    JSON_VALUE(dl_payload, '$.data.accountingConditions[0].marketplace') AS accounting_condition_marketplace,
    JSON_VALUE(dl_payload, '$.data.accountingConditions[0].partner') AS accounting_condition_partner,
    JSON_VALUE(dl_payload, "$.data.unit") AS partnerincentive_unit,
    JSON_VALUE(dl_payload, "$.data.value") AS partnerincentive_value,
    JSON_VALUE(dl_payload, "$.data.partner.name") AS partner_name,
    JSON_VALUE(number    , '$.mode') AS assortment_condition_mode,
    JSON_VALUE(number    , '$.type') AS assortment_condition_type,
    assortment_condition_value,
    dl_partition_day_utc,
    dl_insert_timestamp_utc
FROM
    dataset.table_name
, UNNEST(JSON_QUERY_ARRAY(JSON_QUERY(dl_payload, '$.data.assortmentConditions')) ) AS number
    -- comma instead of CROSS JOIN
, UNNEST(JSON_VALUE_ARRAY(JSON_QUERY(number, '$.values'))) AS assortment_condition_value
    -- comma instead of CROSS JOIN
    -- JSON_VALUE_ARRAY because we want the value of the string and not the object (which is '\"string\"')
;
```
## ARRAY Functions

### ARRAY_AGG()

You are also able to revert the result set of a query to an array by using the function ARRAY_AGG()

```
SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    date,
    ARRAY_AGG(v2ProductName) AS products_viewed,
    ARRAY_AGG(pageTitle) AS pages_viewed
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
WHERE visitId = 1501570398
GROUP BY fullVisitorId, date
ORDER BY date
```
### ARRAY_LENGTH()

Query the length of an array by using ARRAY_LENGTH().

```
SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    date,
    ARRAY_AGG(v2ProductName) AS products_viewed,
    ARRAY_AGG(pageTitle) AS pages_viewed
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
WHERE visitId = 1501570398
GROUP BY fullVisitorId, date
ORDER BY date
```
